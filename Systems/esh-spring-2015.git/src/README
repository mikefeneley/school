How to execute the shell
------------------------

Create an executable by using the "make command.
Then run the executable by typing "./esh"

Important Notes
---------------

Our shell implements both basic and extended functionality.
Most of our code is contained in the helper.c and job-manager.c
files. Plugins were implemented in plugin.c.

We relied heaviliy on the GNU website detailing shell implmentation.
We used stack overflow and the man pages as a reference.
We used the provided code written by Godmar Bach from the website faq section.

GNU Reference:
http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Initializing-the-Shell.html


Description of Base Functionality
---------------------------------

We pass all base functionality tests.

We implemented the jobs command by keeping
a list of current job. When the jobs command
is invoked, we traverse the list and print
the required information about each command.

We implemnted the fg command by having the shell
traverse the list from back to front 
looking for a background or stopped job. It then gives
that job command of the terminal using Professor Bach's
provided funciton.

We implemnted the bg function by searching for the stopped
job and sending it a SIGCONT signal.

We implemnted kill by traversing the list and then sending the
SIGTERM signal to the job.

We implemented the stop function by traversing the list and
sending the proper job the SIGTSTP signal.

We implemnted \ˆC by using the SIGCHLD handler to catch
the terminated child process's signal and then removing
it from the list.

We implemented \ˆZ by using the SIGCHLD handler to catch 
the child process's signal and then update the jobs status.


Description of Extended Functionality
-------------------------------------
<describe your IMPLEMENTATION of the following functionality:

We implemented I/O and pipes by checking the nature of the
job and updating the file descriptors accordingly.

We implemnted exclusive access by managing terminal access.
